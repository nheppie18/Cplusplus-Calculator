Gaining understanding of the C++ programming language by by using loops, switches, conditionals and classes to create a command-line calculator. This calculator is capable of multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, and exponents. It also has the functionality to continue doing operations off of a previous answer like a normal calculator, and can clear to start fresh.
